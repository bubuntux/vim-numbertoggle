INTRODUCTION                                    *numbertoggle*

In a buffer with "hybrid" line numbers (`:set number relativenumber`),
numbertoggle switches to absolute line numbers (`:set number norelativenumber`)
automatically when relative numbers don't make sense.

Relative numbers are only used in a buffer that has focus, and is in normal
mode, since that's where you move around. They're turned off when you switch
out of Vim, switch to another split, or when you go into insert mode.
